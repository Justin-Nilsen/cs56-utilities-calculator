**DESRIPTION**

A graphical calculator written in Java

![](http://i.imgur.com/b8w5bk8.png)

A simple 4 function calculator that takes two numbers and adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides them.  Newer version comes with power and root support.  Supports floating point math, negative numbers, and comes with Clear and Delete buttons to erase result and inputs.

**HOW TO USE IT**

Users can use their keyboard or mouse to input the numbers and operators.  Operations are limited to one operator per operation.  Any legal input a user provides will be displayed on the Calculator at the top right.  Pressing Enter will start the operation, which will return a number as the answer and display it.  Pressing the Delete key will erase the most recent input, and hitting Clear will erase the entire display.
