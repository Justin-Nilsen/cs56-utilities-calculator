a) A basic 4-function caluclator with a Swing GUI and large buttons.

b) As a user, I can click on buttons and they show up as numbers or symbols in the display.
As a user, I can press the 'Enter' button to evaluate an arithmetic expression.
As a user, I can click the 'Clear' button to erase the display.
As a user, I can click the 'Delete' button to remove the previous input.

c) It runs and calculates simple arithmetic expressions.

d) As a user, I would like to be able to calculate square root with the calculator.
As a user, I would like a seperate button to denote positive an negative values instead of the minutes button.
As a user, I would like a second display row which shows the previously inputted values and symbols.

e) Readme is incomplete. Does not have instructions on how to use or how to run or requirements or anything. It just a picture of the GUI.

f) None of the targets have descriptions.

g) Yes there is enough and they seem clear enough for now, we may need clarification down the road.

h) Add support for square root operation: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-calculator/issues/25
Numbers can be added to the answer: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-calculator/issues/26
Make display more user-friendly: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-calculator/issues/27
Add a negative/positive toggle button: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-calculator/issues/28

i) The code is not very clear or well organized; I would tell someone that the Calculator class handles calculation, the CalcualtorGUI class handles the GUI, and the Keypad class handles the button listeners, JLabelMessageDestination is the number display.

j) There are no tests.
